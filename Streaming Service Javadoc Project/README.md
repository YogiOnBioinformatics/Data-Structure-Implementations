The purpose of this project was to learn about JavaDoc annotation and how to properly annotate code. 

The empty Java files given to me were about a hypothetical streaming service and how I would create "StreamingRadio", "User", "Song" and "Station" data structures. Based on what I expect each data structure to do, I filled out the JavaDoc annotations.
