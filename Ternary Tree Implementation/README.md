The purpose of this project was to be able to implement a "TernaryTree" data structure. A Ternary Tree is a data structure where any node is allowed to have up to a maximum of three children nodes. This is in contrast to a Binary Tree where the maximum number of children for any single node is two. 

The implementation Java files as well as the usage of these files is located in the /src/ folder whereas the explanation of each used data structure is located in the /doc/ folder
