**EXAMPLE USAGE**

The "TernaryTreeTester" class is the only Java file in this /src/ folder that has a "main" method. If you would like to run your own tests, then go ahead and create your tester class. If you'd rather look at my in-depth tests, then read my tester class and then you'll see that my code works without issues. 

COMPILATION: 

    - javac TernaryTreeTester.java

EXECUTION: 

    - java TernaryTreeTester
