**EXAMPLE USAGE**

Compilation: 

    -javac InfixExpressionEvaluator.java

Execution: 

    -java InfixExpressionEvaluator


Note that the "InfixExpressionEvaluator" Java file is the only main that contains a main method. For this reason, this is what any user would be expected to run and compile!
