My FIRST EVER implementation of a Data Structure completed! The point of this project was to be able to create a "Set" Data Structure that was generic, in its ability to hold all other data types.

This was then used as a dependent class of a "Profile" data structure which was meant to mimic a user profile on a social media website. 

The interfaces "ProfileInterface" and "SetInterface" were created so as to abstract away from the code and understand the purpose of the methods that needed to be implemented. 

"Social Client" is the actual application that uses a "Profile" data structure which represents a specific person opening the menu for a social media website. The "Social Client" asks users whether they would like to create a profile, follow users, get recommendations, etc. This is basically the same as what you would expect of a regular social media website in the modern age.
